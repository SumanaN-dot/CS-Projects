Project Overview
This is my CSCI 1301 Project 1 for the University of Georgia, which focuses on basic programming concepts in Java. The goal of the project is to apply foundational skills such as input/output, variables, conditionals, loops, and simple methods to build a functional program.

Project Description
In this project, I developed a Java application designed to read in the grade weightsfor a class and user's known scores for grades, 
then compute their current average as well as tell them if they can achieve their desired grade. 
The program takes user input for grade weights and known scores, performs calculations or operations using average, and outputs current average. This project helped solidify concepts like:

Variables and Data Types: Proper use of integers, floats, strings, etc.
Conditionals and Loops: Decision-making using if-else statements, looping constructs such as for and while.
Methods: Creating reusable code blocks for better structure.
