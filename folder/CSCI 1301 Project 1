Project Overview
This is my CSCI 1301 Project 1 for the University of Georgia, which focuses on basic programming concepts in Java. The goal of the project is to apply foundational skills such as input/output, variables, conditionals, loops, and simple methods to build a functional program.

Project Description
In this project, I developed a credit pay off program. The program takes user input for tax payments, performs calculations or operations using mathematical function, and outputs
the credit card pay off. This project helped solidify concepts like:

Variables and Data Types: Proper use of integers, floats, strings, etc.
Conditionals and Loops: Decision-making using if-else statements, looping constructs such as for and while.
Methods: Creating reusable code blocks for better structure.
